    p Coaching gave me a lot of confidence to lead when needed
    p Being a leader taught me to see other perspectives more clearly
    p Coaching also taught me the ability to break down momvements/task into smaller coachable points which helps me when making todo lists (Throwing the football efficiently for instance has 7 coaching points)
    p The team also has a great motto which I strive to follow "Laget f√∂re jaget" which is directly translated to "Team before me"
